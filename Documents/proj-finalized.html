<h1>Project Finalized Main Window</h1>

<p>Once the project is complete, the welcome screen image is replaced by the data image. This includes a schematic of the selected matching network, and the component values. This is a GIF image, and may be saved as such. It is viewable from any image viewer that can display GIFs (almost all of them). The image may also be printed out as hard copy. There is a potential pitfall to doing so: some printers these days aren't Post 'Script printers: the format FOX uses to print files. As an alternative, the design data may also be printed as text only. There is a possibility of saving to a Post Script file that can be converted by other means.</p>

<p>After project completion, a new project can be started without having to exit and restart the application. All previous data will be lost, and if not saved, the user will be prompted to save the current project before starting a new one if it hasn't been saved already.</p>
