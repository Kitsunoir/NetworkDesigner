<h1 style="text-align: center">Project Display Pane</h1>

<p>When "New Project" is selected from either the main menu or the tool bar, the design pane replaces the main window. The needed command buttons and menu items activate from their grayed-out state. The design pane consists of two parts. There is the user data entry area. Next to it, is a text viewer that shows a brief description of the design options. The divider between the data entry pane and the text viewer is resizable by dragging the vertical divider.</p>

<p>The design choices are shown via a drop-down menu that appears when the button is clicked. Items may be selected more than once for convenient review of the descriptions. The text view area may be edited if it's desired to display the description in a different text editor. These changes aren't saved within the application, however.</p>

<p>The text fields accept up to 16 characters. Values may be made in terms of Hz, KHz, or MHz for frequency, and K or MEG for impedances. These values are appropriately scaled for performing the calculations. No trailing modifiers default to Hz and ohms. Values may also be entered in exponential notation, for example: 7.0E6 instead of 7.0MHz. These text fields may be cycled through in order via the &lt;TAB&gt; key.</p>

<p>The command buttons also activate at this time. The "OK" button finalizes the project. If entries are required, but not supplied, an error advisory dialog will alert the user as to the situation. The missing data will receive focus, so that the correct value(s) may be entered. The "Clear" button removes text from all the text fields. "Cancel" is an alias for new project.</p>

<p>Once the project is finalized, the user is returned to the main screen.</p>
